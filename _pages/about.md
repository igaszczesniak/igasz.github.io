Hi there! I'm Iga.

Iâ€™m a Space Innovation Engineer at the European Space Agency. I hold an MSc in Geoinformatics from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow and Aalto University. My academic background focuses on remote sensing and the management and processing of diverse geospatial data, including satellite, radar, and Internet-of-Things data.

Along the way, I became increasingly interested in the commercialisation of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public demands, and inform policies. To further pursue this interest, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, management, and space entrepreneurship.

My career goal is to connect cutting-edge space technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have over two years of professional experience in the space sector, working across various ESA directorates (ESRIN, HQ) and the AIR Centre EO Lab, a research centre dedicated for Earth observation.

I tend to focus on topics related to satellite sensors, the environment, and coding. However, I stay curious about various space and non-space techs. I am currently interested in:

* Earth Observation 
* Artificial Intelligence
* Large Language Models
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Climate
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

I engage in *a lot* of outdoor activities, especially kitesurfing, scuba diving, freediving, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, climbing, and more. Other than that, I try my best to write a children's book about satellites and adventures.
