Hi there! I'm Iga.

I'm an Earth Observation Project Developer at the Atlantic International Research Centre. I obtained a MSc in Geoinformatics, Photogrammetry, and Remote Sensing from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, which included a one-year exchange program at Aalto University, Finland. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in working with various data types and processing techniques (including satellite and Internet-of-Things), as well as data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Ultimately, it inspired me to specialize in Synthetic Aperture Radar technology, which is particularly effective due to its ability to provide imaging through clouds, during the night, and in poor weather conditions. Along the way, I became increasingly interested in the commercialization of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public demands, and inform policies. To further pursue this interest, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, management, and space entrepreneurship.

My career objective is to connect cutting-edge technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have gained over two years of professional experience in the space industry, including an internship at the European Space Agency and my current position at the EO Lab, established as an ESA Laboratory.

In my role, I apply my interdisciplinary skills to a blend of technical, scientific, industrial, and outreach activities. I manage and develop projects related to Earth Observation, Internet-of-Things, and NewSpace. Additionally, I serve on the organizing committee of JuliaEO â€“ Global Workshop on Earth Observation with Julia and advocate for using this high-performance programming language within the geospatial community.

My interests include:

* Earth Observation 
* Data Science 
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Climate
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks
