Hi there! I'm Iga.

I'm an Earth Observation Project Developer at the Atlantic International Research Centre. I obtained a MSc in Geoinformatics from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland and Aalto University, Finland. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in working with various data types and processing techniques (including satellite, SAR, and IoT), as well as data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Along the way, I became increasingly interested in the commercialization of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public demands, and inform policies. To further pursue this interest, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, management, and space entrepreneurship.

My career objective is to connect cutting-edge technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have gained over two years of professional experience in the space industry, including an internship at the European Space Agency and my current position at the EO Lab, established as an ESA Laboratory.

I am passionate about:

* Earth Observation 
* Data Science 
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Climate
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

Other than that, I engage in a lot of outdoor activities and try my best to write a children's book.
