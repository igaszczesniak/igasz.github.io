Hi there! I'm Iga.

I'm an Earth Observation Project Developer at the Atlantic International Research Centre. I earned an MSc in Geoinformatics from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland, and Aalto University, Finland. My academic background has given me a strong foundation in handling diverse data types and processing techniques, including *satellite*, *radar*, and *internet-of-things* data. Along the way, I became increasingly interested in the commercialization of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public demands, and inform policies. To further pursue this interest, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, management, and space entrepreneurship.

My career objective is to connect cutting-edge space technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have gained over two years of professional experience working in the downstream space sector, including an internship at the European Space Agency and my current position at the EO Lab, established as an ESA Laboratory.

I tend to focus on topics related to satellite sensors, the environment, and coding. However, I stay curious about various space and non-space techs as well. I am currently interested in:

* Earth Observation 
* Data Science 
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Climate
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

I engage in *a lot* of outdoor activities, especially kitesurfing, scuba diving, freediving, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, climbing, and more. Other than that, I try my best to write a children's book about satellites and adventures.
