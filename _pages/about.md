Hi there! I'm Iga.

Iâ€™m a Space Innovation Engineer at the European Space Agency. I hold an MSc in Geoinformatics from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow and Aalto University in Finland.

I have been trained in remote sensing and the management and processing of diverse spaceborne data, including satellite, radar, and Internet-of-Things data.

Over time, I became increasingly interested in the commercialization of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public needs, and inform policy. To deepen my expertise, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, AI, management, and space entrepreneurship.

My career goal is to connect cutting-edge space technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have over three years of professional experience in the space sector, working across various ESA directorates (ESRIN, HQ) and the AIR Centre EO Lab, a research center dedicated to Earth observation.

At work, I analyze various space-related technologies, though I am particularly interested in:

* Earth Observation 
* Artificial Intelligence
* AI Agents 
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

I engage in *a lot* of outdoor activities, especially kitesurfing, scuba diving, freediving, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, climbing, and more. Other than that, I try my best to write a children's book about satellites and adventures.
