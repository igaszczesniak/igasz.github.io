<p>My company has been involved in a consortium to launch the Earth observation satellite <em>AEROS-MH1</em>, and I wrote the backend to track its position. I have used a satellite orbit obtained from a TLE (Two-Line Element) file from CelesTrak to create an orbit propagator using the SGP4 algorithm. Next, I converted the position vectors to the World Geodetic System (WGS-84).</p>
