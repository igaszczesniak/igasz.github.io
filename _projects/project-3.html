<p>We all want better wines! We have installed four Internet-of-Things sensors across four different vineyards in Biscoitos, Terceira Island to collect hourly weather data, allowing us to closely monitor conditions.</p>

<p>I have developed a dashboard to monitor these vineyards in real-time. The dashboard uses time series data on temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and solar radiation to assess the risk of primary infection of downy mildew, a disease that attacks healthy vines.</p>

<p>Check out the dashboard <a href="https://services.aircentre.org/agrodigital/terceira/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It was a fun project to work on and to practice using Julia for web development. I used Dash.jl and, to be honest, I really liked this framework. Also, it was exciting to create a tool that can actually be <em>useful</em> for winemakers, allowing them to track periods of primary infection and take preventive measures.
    The webpage is currently in Portuguese as we wanted it to be tailored for local Azorean producers. The English version, along with code, can be viewed in this <a href="https://github.com/igaszczesniak/dashboard-julia">Notebook</a>.</p>
