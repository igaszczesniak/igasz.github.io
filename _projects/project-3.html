<p>We all want better wines! We have installed four Internet-of-Things sensors across four different vineyards in Biscoitos, Terceira Island to collect hourly weather data, allowing us to closely monitor conditions.</p>

<p>I have developed a real-time dashboard to track these vineyards. The dashboard utilizes time series data on temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation to assess the risk of primary downy mildew infection, a disease that attacks healthy vines.</p>

<p>Check out the dashboard <a href="https://services.aircentre.org/agrodigital/terceira/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It was a fun project to work on and to practice using Julia for web development. I used Dash.jl and, to be honest, I really liked this framework. Also, it was exciting to create a tool that can actually be useful for winemakers, allowing them to track periods of primary infection and take preventive measures.
    The webpage is in Portuguese as we wanted it to be tailored for local Azorean communities, but I will also create a Medium post with an English description soon.</p>
