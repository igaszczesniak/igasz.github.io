<!--
The primary aim was to assess the spectral signatures of grass across various pastures, both with and without spores of 𝘗𝘪𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘮𝘺𝘤𝘦𝘴 𝘤𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘳𝘶𝘮, at different altitudes. This involved utilizing optical data from satellites, drone, and in-situ measurements with a spectroradiometer. With the data from this test campaign, the influence of grass quality and nutrients on spore production will be studied through the use of existing vegetation indices or developing new ones, based on the spectral signatures obtained.
